Predicting Balance of Payments Crises in the IMF’s Largest Debtor: A Machine Learning Approach to Argentina’s Recurrent External Crises.

This study assesses the performance and variable selection of a Random Forest model (RF) trained on Argentinian economic data to make early predictions and evaluate the persistence of balance of payments crises. The model was trained using data from 2004 to 2020 and tested with data from 2021 to 2023. Depending on the definition of external crisis adopted, the RF model achieved an F1 score between 0.88 and 1. This customized model identified specific signalling variables unique to Argentina, which differ from those used in cross-country machine learning models. In predicting both new and continued BOP crises, the RF model emphasized variables from the fiscal and external sectors. The findings suggest that a combination of expansionary fiscal policy and exchange rate overvaluation could signal an imminent balance of payments crisis or indicate the continuation of an existing one. Relying solely on fiscal variables to predict a BOP crisis can be misleading in the case of Argentina.
